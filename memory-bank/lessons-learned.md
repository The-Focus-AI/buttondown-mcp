# Lessons Learned

## Project Structure and Organization

[2024-03-26 21:34] Project Structure: Organizing project with memory-bank directory for documentation → Created dedicated files for different aspects (project-brief.md, active-context.md, etc.) → Why: Essential for maintaining clear project context and progress tracking across multiple aspects of development.

[2024-03-26 21:34] Documentation Strategy: Need for comprehensive documentation across different areas → Implemented separate files for technical context, active work, and progress → Why: Helps maintain clear separation of concerns and makes it easier to track different aspects of the project.

## Technical Implementation

[2024-03-26 21:34] API Integration: Issue: Initial API integration lacked proper type definitions → Fix: Generated types based on actual API responses stored in api-responses directory → Why: Ensures type definitions match real API behavior and prevents runtime type mismatches.

[2024-03-26 21:34] Authentication: Challenge with secure API key management → Solution: Implemented 1Password integration for API key storage → Why: Critical for maintaining security best practices and preventing accidental exposure of credentials.

[2024-03-26 21:34] MCP Tools: Initial tool implementations lacked proper validation → Added Zod schemas for parameter validation and improved error handling → Why: Essential for providing clear feedback and preventing invalid API calls.

## Development Process

[2024-03-26 21:34] Testing Strategy: Need for comprehensive testing across different layers → Implemented unit tests, CLI command tests, and planned MCP server tests → Why: Ensures reliability and catches issues early in development.

[2024-03-26 21:34] Package Management: Decision to use pnpm as package manager → Implemented workspace setup with pnpm → Why: Provides better dependency management and disk space efficiency.

## Error Handling and Edge Cases

[2024-03-26 21:34] Error Handling: Initial error messages weren't user-friendly → Improved error handling with descriptive messages → Why: Better user experience and easier debugging.

[2024-03-26 21:34] API Key Validation: Initial implementation checked API key too frequently → Optimized to check only during command execution → Why: Improves performance and user experience.

## Documentation and User Experience

[2024-03-26 21:34] Tool Documentation: Initial tool descriptions lacked clarity → Added comprehensive descriptions and parameter documentation → Why: Essential for users to understand tool capabilities and requirements.

[2024-03-26 21:34] Progress Tracking: Need for clear progress indicators → Added status markers [X], [-], [ ], [!], [?] → Why: Provides clear visual indication of task status and progress.

## Integration and Testing

[2024-03-26 21:34] Integration Testing: Need for thorough testing of MCP server → Planned comprehensive test suite including unit and integration tests → Why: Ensures reliability and proper functionality of all components.

[2024-03-26 21:34] Email Scheduling: Complex edge cases in email scheduling → Implemented proper validation and error handling → Why: Prevents invalid scheduling attempts and provides clear feedback.

## Security and Best Practices

[2024-03-26 21:34] Security: Need for secure credential handling → Implemented 1Password integration and never store API key in code → Why: Critical for maintaining security and preventing credential exposure.

[2024-03-26 21:34] Input Validation: Need for thorough parameter validation → Implemented Zod schemas for all tool parameters → Why: Prevents invalid input and provides clear error messages.

## Future Considerations

[2024-03-26 21:34] Rate Limiting: Need to handle API rate limits → Planned implementation of rate limiting handling → Why: Prevents API abuse and ensures reliable operation.

[2024-03-26 21:34] Progress Indicators: Need for better progress feedback → Planned implementation of progress indicators → Why: Improves user experience during long-running operations.

## Deployment and Maintenance

[2024-03-26 21:34] CI/CD Setup: Need for automated testing and deployment → Planned implementation of CI/CD pipeline → Why: Ensures consistent testing and deployment process.

[2024-03-26 21:34] Documentation Maintenance: Need for keeping documentation up-to-date → Created structured documentation system → Why: Ensures documentation remains useful and accurate.
